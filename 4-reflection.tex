\section{Future work}

\subsection{Evaluating layout}

Section~\ref{sec:whatmakesgood} has shown that there is a lack of research into how layout affects argument. The body of evidence in other domains, such as software modelling, highlights the usefulness of such research -- but whether arguments are read differently to other types of domain graph, and whether if so this difference should affect the way they are laid out, is not clear.



\subsection{Implementation}

\citet{5674033}'s recommendations, about the way in which automatic layout features should be exposed to the user, have thus far been ignored. Extending Artoo to better support manual adjustment of layout -- perhaps by the addition of ``snap to align'', or allowing multiple elements to be moved at once -- is one way this could be achieved. In the context of the notion that users don't [like to] separate editing and creating, it should be considered that process of building arguments -- adding nodes and connections -- and  . These interactions should be moved to the canvas \ldots more direct manipulation. This was outside of the scope of this project.
