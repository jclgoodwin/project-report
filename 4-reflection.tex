\section{Future work}

\subsection{[Evaluating layout]}

The [review] section has shown that there is a lack of research into [not only the impact of using argumentation notations at all but] how layout affects argument comprehension. The body of evidence in other domains, such as software modelling, highlights the usefulness of such research -- but whether arguments are read differently, and in a way that affects , is yet to be confirmed.


\subsection{Implementation}

\citet{5674033}'s recommendations, about how automatic layout features should be exposed to the user, have thus far been ignored. Extending Artoo to better support manual adjustment of layout -- perhaps by the addition of [snap to align to grid], or allowing multiple elements to be moved at once. In the context of the notion that users don't [like to] separate editing and creating, it should be considered that  process of building arguments -- adding nodes and connections -- and  . These interactions should be moved to the canvas \ldots more direct manipulation. This was outside of the scope of this project.
